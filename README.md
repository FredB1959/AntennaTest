Simple program can be used with a Arduino compiler

There is a receiver program for a WeMos module: AntennaTestRec_wemos
There is a receiver program for a ESP32 module. tested on Tbeam and Heltec v1

The sender program can be used with a Tbeam:


These programs are based on the programs publishes by SensorsIot found here:
